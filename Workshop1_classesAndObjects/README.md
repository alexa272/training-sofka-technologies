### Author: Alexandra Santa Muñoz

In this repository the topic of class and object modeling in Java is developed, it contains the following files:

- BankAccount.java, Fruit.java, main.java, Person.java, Ball.java, Coin.java, Vehicle.java

## REPOSITORY FILE DESCRIPTION:
**BankAccount:** in the BankAccount.java or BankAccount.java class file, you are going to find everything you need to create the setup of a conventional Bank account.

## *Description of the BankAccount.java class:* 
the BankAccount class is conformed by the following Attributes:

**ownerName:** Represents the variable where the name of the account owner is found. type string.

**balance:** Represents the variable where the balance in the account will be stored, type int.
**accountNumber:** Represents the variable where the account number will be stored, type int.
**Activated:** Represents the variable to store if the account is active or inactive, type boolean.

## Processes carried out in the BankAccount class:
1. The constructor to the BankAccount class is created so that when desired it can be instantiated.
2. Get and set methods are created to obtain and set data such as account number, account status (active or inactive), available balance in the account and name of the account owner.
3. Create methods to deposit and withdraw balance.  

## Description of Fruit.java class:
The Fruit class consists of the following attributes:

**name:** Represents the variable where the name of the fruit will be stored, String type. 
**AverageWeight:** Represents the variable where the average weight of the fruit will be stored, type float.
**colors:** Represents the variable where an array with the different colors of the fruits will be stored. it is an array of colors, string type.
**size: ** Represents the variable where the size of the fruit will be stored. type float.

## Processes carried out in the Fruit Class:
1. The constructor is created for the Fruit class so that it can be instantiated when desired.
2. Get and set methods are created to obtain and set data such as name, color, size and average weight of the fruit.
 
## Description of Person.java: class
The Person class is conformed by the following Attributes:

**document:** Represents the variable where the person's document number will be stored, data type int.

**lastName2:** Represents the variable where the second last name of the person will be stored. String data type.
**dateBirth:** Represents the variable where the person's date of birth information will be stored. Date data type.

## Processes carried out in the Person class:
1. The constructor to the Person class is created so that when desired it can be instantiated.
2. Get and set methods are created to obtain and set data such as name, surname, date of birth. 
3. Methods such as sleep, run, walk and jump are created.

## Description of class vehicle.java:
the vehicle class is conformed by the following Attributes:

**type:** Represents the variable where the type of vehicle will be stored (Bicycle, car, boat, etc). String data type. 
**weigth:** It represents the variable where the vehicle weight will be stored. Data type double. 
**colors:** Represents the variable where an array with the different colors of the vehicles will be stored. A String array of colors is used. 
**numberOfPassengers:** Represents the variable where the information of the number of passengers that fit in each vehicle will be stored. Data type int.

## Processes carried out in the vehicle class:
The constructor to the vehicle class is created so that it can be instantiated when desired.
Get and set methods are created to obtain and set data such as vehicle type, weight, color and number of passengers.

## Description of class Coin.java:

the coin class is conformed by the following Attributes:

**Color:** is used to define the color of coins. 
**Weight:** is used to define the weight of coins
**form:** is used to define the shape of coins
**material:** is used to define the material of the coins
**value:** is used to define the value of coins

## Processes carried out in the currency class:
1. The constructor to the coin class is created so that it can be instantiated when desired.
2. Get and set methods are created to obtain and set data such as Color, Weight, form, material, value;

## Description of main.java

Normally has the function of displaying the classes created in each project, in this case it is not yet used.

## Description of class Ball.java:

The ball class is conformed by the following Attributes:

**Weight:** is used to define the weight of ball.
**Color:** is used to define the color of ball. 
**Shape:** is used to define shape of ball.

**pressure:** is used to define the pressure of ball.


## Processes carried out in the ball class:
1. The constructor to the ball class is created so that it can be instantiated when desired.
2. Get and set methods are created to obtain and set data such as weight, color, shape, type y pressure

## Description of main.java

Normally has the function of displaying the classes created in each project, in this case it is not yet used.
